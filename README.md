# sxy-plane
A C++ library for scanning and pathfinding in 2D space

This project seeks to be a useful solution to a few problems:
- scan and map the topography of an unknown space
- find the shortest path between two points in a known space
- given a known map with traversal weights find the shortest path
- plot a map from directions

This project seeks to be a better solution than juggling vectors of vectors of chars.
